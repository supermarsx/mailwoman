# Versioning

Mailwoman uses a **rolling release** scheme in **`YY.N`** format.

- **`YY`** — two-digit calendar year of the release (e.g. `26` for 2026).
- **`N`** — the release number within that year, starting at **1** and
  **resetting to 1 each new calendar year**.

Examples, in order: `26.1`, `26.2`, `26.3`, … then `27.1`, `27.2`, …

There is no separate major/minor/patch. Each tagged release is a self-contained
rolling snapshot; the sequence is strictly increasing within a year, and the
year boundary resets `N`.

## Git tags

Releases are tagged **bare** (no `v` prefix): `26.1`, `26.2`, …
Tags are annotated and signed where possible.

## Package manifests (semver-shaped ecosystems)

Cargo and npm require semver (`X.Y.Z`). We map `YY.N` → **`YY.N.0`**:

- `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package] version` → `26.1.0`
- `apps/web/package.json` `version` → `26.1.0`

The third component (`.0`) is reserved for the rare out-of-band hotfix to an
already-tagged release (`26.1.1`); normal forward progress increments `N`
(`26.2`), not the patch field.

## Release checklist

1. Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` and `apps/web/package.json` to `YY.N.0`.
2. Update this file's example if the year rolled over.
3. Commit `chore(release): YY.N`.
4. Tag: `git tag -a YY.N -m "Mailwoman YY.N"` then `git push origin YY.N`.

## History

- **`26.1`** — first rolling release. V0 walking skeleton (SPEC §27): wired
  webmail path (SolidJS client → mw-server JMAP proxy + sanitize worker →
  JMAP upstream), Docker/CI, E2E. Supersedes the pre-adoption `v0.0.0`
  placeholder tag, which was removed.
